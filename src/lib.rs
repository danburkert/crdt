/// A Conflict-free Replicated Data Type.
///
/// Conflict-free replicated data types (also called convergent and commutative
/// replicated data types) allow for concurrent updates to distributed replicas
/// with strong eventual consistency and without coordination.
///
/// ###### Replication
///
/// Updates to CRDTs can be shared with replicas in two ways: state-based
/// replication and operation-based replication. With state-based replication,
/// the entire state of the mutated CRDT is merged into remote replicas in order
/// to restore consistency. With operation-based replication, only the mutating
/// operation is applied to remote replicas in order to restore consistency.
/// Operation-based replication is lighter weight in terms of the amount of
/// data which must be transmitted to replicas per mutation, but has the
/// requirement that all operations must be reliably broadcast and applied to
/// remote replicas. State-based replication schemes can maintain (eventual)
/// consistency merely by guaranteeing that state based replication will
/// (eventually) happen. Shapiro, et al. have shown that state-based CRDTs are
/// equivalent to operation-based CRDTs. The CRDTs exposed by this library
/// allow for either state-based or operation-based replication, or a mix of
/// both.
///
/// ###### Replica ID
///
/// Many CRDTs require a `uint` identifier, or replica ID, upon creation. The
/// replica ID **must** be unique among replicas, so it should be taken from
/// unique per-replica configuration, or from a source of strong coordination
/// such as [ZooKeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) or
/// [etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) (implementing a Rust client for these
/// services is left as an exercise for the reader).
///
/// ###### Transaction IDs
///
/// Many CRDTs require the user to provide a transaction ID when performing
/// mutating operations. Transaction IDs provided to an individual replica
/// **must** be monotonically increasing across operations. Transaction IDs
/// across replicas **must** be unique, and **should** be as close to globally
/// monotonically increasing as possible. Unlike replicas IDs, these
/// requirements do not require strong coordination among replicas. See
/// [Snowflake](https://github.com/twitter/snowflake) for an example of
/// distributed, uncoordinated ID generation which meets the requirements.
///
/// ###### Partial Ordering
///
/// Replicas of a CRDT are partially-ordered over the set of possible
/// operations. If all operations applied to replica `B` have been applied to
/// `A` (or, somewhat equivalently, if `B` has been merged into `A`), then
/// `A <= B`.
///
/// ###### Equality
///
/// Equality among CRDT replicas does not take into account the replica ID;
/// only the operation history is taken into account.
pub trait Crdt<Operation> : PartialOrd + Clone {

    /// Merge a replica into this CRDT.
    ///
    /// This method is used to perform state-based replication.
    fn merge(&mut self, other: Self);

    /// Apply an operation to this CRDT.
    ///
    /// This method is used to perform operation-based replication.
    fn apply(&mut self, operation: Operation);
}
